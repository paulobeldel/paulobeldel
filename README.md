<h1 align="center"> 👨🏻‍💻 Hello world! I'm Paulo Beldel Filho 👋🏻 </h1> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am currently pursuing a Degree in Cybersecurity, and I am also taking a software development course. </p>    
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I’m a specialist in <b> investments and finance </b>, and throughout my career, I faced challenges related to data extraction and analysis. </p>    
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Since I don’t usually shy away from a good challenge, I started to study <b> Python </b> in a self-taught way — and that’s when I discovered my passion for technology. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Today, I’m transitioning into the tech field, combining my background in finance with the power of programming. </p>  
<p style="text-align: justify;"> My goal is to turn challenges into learning opportunities and ideas into solutions. 🚀 </p>
