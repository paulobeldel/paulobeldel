# 👩‍💻 Hello world! I'm Paulo Beldel Filho 👋 

I’m a specialist in investments and finance, and throughout my career, I faced challenges related to data extraction and analysis.   
Since I don’t usually shy away from a good challenge, I started learning Python — and that’s when I discovered my passion for technology.
Today, I’m transitioning into the tech field, combining my background in finance with the power of programming.  
My goal is to turn challenges into learning opportunities and ideas into solutions. 🚀
